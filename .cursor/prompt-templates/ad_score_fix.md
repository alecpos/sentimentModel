# ML Model Complexity Resolution Protocol
**Target File:** app/models/ml/prediction/ad_score_predictor.py  
**Current Complexity:** 163  
**Acceptable Threshold:** <50  

## Refactoring Steps
1. **Class Decomposition**  
   Split complex components into:
   - `CrossModalAttention` (Keep as is - reasonable complexity)
   - `MultiModalFeatureExtractor` â†’ Split into:
     - `MultiModalFeatureExtractorBase` (Core embedding logic)
     - `CulturalEmbeddingProcessor` (Cultural embedding handling)
     - `FeatureTransformPipeline` (Transform pipeline)
   - `QuantumNoiseLayer` (Keep as is - specialized ML component)
   - `SplineCalibrator` (Keep as is - mathematical component)

2. **Type Safety Enforcement**  
   - Add return types for all methods
   - Implement validation for:
     - transform() inputs/outputs
     - cultural embedding indices
     - feature dimensions
   - Add tensor shape assertions

3. **ML Component Organization**
   - Extract embedding logic into dedicated classes
   - Implement feature caching
   - Add gradient checkpointing
   - Separate model validation logic

4. **Validation Requirements**
   - Maintain test coverage (currently high)
   - Preserve PyTorch model interfaces
   - Keep protected ML functions (marked with # CursorKeep)
   - Ensure backward compatibility for model loading

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement memory-efficient forward passes
   - Add batch processing capabilities
   - Optimize cultural embedding lookups
   - Consider quantization where appropriate

## Implementation Notes
- Use PyTorch best practices for model composition
- Implement proper device management
- Add logging for training/inference
- Include error handling for edge cases
- Document model assumptions and limitations

## Critical Functions to Preserve
- MultiModalFeatureExtractor.transform()
- CrossModalAttention.forward()
- QuantumNoiseLayer._update_hessian_estimate()
- SplineCalibrator.forward()

## Type Signatures to Maintain
- transform(data: Dict) -> torch.Tensor
- _get_cultural_embedding(region: str) -> torch.Tensor
- forward(x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor
