# ML Robustness Components

This directory contains components for ensuring the robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks, edge cases, and distribution shifts. These tools help create more reliable models that maintain performance under challenging conditions.

## Directory Structure

- **__init__.py**: Module initialization with component exports
- **attacks.py**: Implementations of various adversarial attacks
- **certification.py**: Robustness certification methods

## Key Components

### AdversarialAttacks
A collection of methods to generate adversarial examples that challenge model predictions.

**Key Features:**
- FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method) attack
- PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) attack
- Boundary-based attacks
- Black-box attack simulations

### RobustnessCertification
Tools for certifying model robustness within certain bounds.

**Key Features:**
- Randomized smoothing certification
- Lipschitz constant estimation
- Formal verification methods
- Uncertainty quantification

## Usage Examples

### Testing Model Robustness

```python
from app.models.ml.robustness import AdversarialAttacks
from app.models.ml.prediction import AdScorePredictor

# Load model
model = AdScorePredictor()

# Create adversarial examples
attack = AdversarialAttacks(attack_type="fgsm", epsilon=0.05)
X_test, y_test = load_test_data()
X_adv = attack.generate(model, X_test, y_test)

# Evaluate model on adversarial examples
original_predictions = model.predict(X_test)
adversarial_predictions = model.predict(X_adv)

# Calculate robustness metrics
robustness_score = calculate_robustness(original_predictions, adversarial_predictions)
print(f"Model robustness score: {robustness_score:.4f}")
```

### Certifying Robustness

```python
from app.models.ml.robustness import RobustnessCertification
from app.models.ml.prediction import AdScorePredictor

# Load model
model = AdScorePredictor()

# Create certification
certifier = RobustnessCertification(method="randomized_smoothing", samples=1000)

# Certify model robustness
X_test = load_test_data()
certification_results = certifier.certify(model, X_test)

# Check certification results
print(f"Average certified radius: {certification_results['avg_radius']:.4f}")
print(f"Certified accuracy at radius 0.1: {certification_results['certified_accuracy_at_0.1']:.2f}%")
```
