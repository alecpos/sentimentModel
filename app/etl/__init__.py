"""
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) components for the WITHIN ML Prediction System.

This package contains data processing pipelines for extracting data from various sources,
transforming it for analysis, and loading it into storage systems. These components
support the data preparation needs of the ML prediction models.

Note: This is a placeholder for the planned ETL components as described in the README.
The actual implementation will be populated as the system develops.
