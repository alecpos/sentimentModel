"""
Core machine learning utilities for the WITHIN ML Prediction System.

This module provides foundational machine learning utilities and infrastructure
that are used across the ML system. It includes components for model loading,
feature processing, prediction handling, and other core ML operations.

Key functionality includes:
- Model loading and initialization
- Feature transformation utilities
- Prediction handling and processing
- ML pipeline components
- Common ML utility functions
