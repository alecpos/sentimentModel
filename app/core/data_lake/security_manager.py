    Designed for secure data storage and transmission within the data lake.

    Key Features:
        - Symmetric encryption using Fernet (AES-128-CBC)
        - Secure key management
        - Built-in timestamp-based key rotation

    Security Notes:
        - The secret key must be 32 url-safe base64-encoded bytes
        - In production, store the key in a secure vault or HSM
        - Rotate keys periodically for enhanced security
        - Consider implementing key versioning for long-term storage
