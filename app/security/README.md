# Security Components

This directory contains security components for the WITHIN ML Prediction System. These components handle authentication, authorization, data protection, and model security to ensure the system operates securely.

## Directory Structure

- **__init__.py**: Module initialization with security component exports
- **model_protection.py**: Implementation of model protection mechanisms

## Key Components

### Model Protection

Located in `model_protection.py`, this module provides mechanisms to protect ML models from unauthorized access, extraction, and tampering:

- **Model encryption**: Encrypts model weights for secure storage
- **Key management**: Handles encryption keys for model protection
- **Secure loading/saving**: Provides methods for securely saving and loading models
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling for security operations

## Planned Components

The following components are planned for future implementation:

- **Authentication**: User authentication mechanisms
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Data encryption**: Mechanisms for encrypting sensitive data
- **Audit logging**: Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events
- **Privacy preservation**: Techniques for preserving user privacy in ML models

## Usage Examples

### Model Protection

```python
from pathlib import Path
from app.security import ModelProtection
import torch.nn as nn

# Create a model
model = nn.Sequential(...)

# Initialize model protection with key path
protection = ModelProtection(key_path=Path("./keys"))

# Save the model securely
protection.save_model(model, Path("./models/protected_model.pt"))

# Later, load the model securely
protection.load_model(model, Path("./models/protected_model.pt"))
```

## Security Principles

The security components adhere to the following principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Components operate with minimal required permissions
3. **Secure by Default**: Security is enabled by default and requires explicit disabling
4. **Fail Secure**: Components fail in a secure state
5. **Open Design**: Security doesn't rely on obscurity of implementation

## Dependencies

- **Python Cryptography**: For cryptographic operations (Fernet)
- **PyTorch**: For model serialization and handling
- **Path**: For secure file handling
- **Logging**: For security event logging
