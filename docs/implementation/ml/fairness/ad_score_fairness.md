# Ad Score Predictor Fairness Assessment

**IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: IMPLEMENTED**


## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive fairness assessment of the Ad Score Predictor model (version 2.1.0). Fairness in machine learning refers to the absence of any prejudice or favoritism toward an individual or group based on inherent or acquired characteristics. For the Ad Score Predictor, we evaluate fairness across multiple dimensions relevant to advertising effectiveness prediction.

## Fairness Dimensions

The Ad Score Predictor is evaluated for fairness across the following dimensions:

1. **Industry Vertical**: Ensuring consistent performance across different industry sectors
2. **Business Size**: Evaluating fairness across businesses of different scales
3. **Platform**: Maintaining consistent performance across advertising platforms
4. **Geography**: Ensuring equitable performance across different regions
5. **Language**: Evaluating fairness across different languages and linguistic styles

## Methodology

Our fairness assessment follows a structured methodology:

### 1. Fairness Metrics

We employ multiple fairness metrics to provide a comprehensive assessment:

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Statistical Parity** | Difference in average predictions across groups | < 5% |
| **Equal Opportunity** | Difference in true positive rates across groups | < 5% |
| **Predictive Parity** | Difference in positive predictive values across groups | < 5% |
| **Calibration by Group** | Consistency of predicted probabilities with observed outcomes | < 0.1 Brier score difference |
| **Disparate Impact** | Ratio of favorable outcome rates between groups | > 0.8 |

### 2. Assessment Process

The fairness assessment process includes:

1. **Data Stratification**: Dividing evaluation data into relevant subgroups
2. **Metric Calculation**: Computing fairness metrics for each subgroup
3. **Statistical Testing**: Determining if differences are statistically significant
4. **Bias Mitigation**: Applying techniques to address identified biases
5. **Validation**: Re-evaluating fairness after mitigation

### 3. Fairness-Accuracy Trade-offs

We explicitly evaluate the trade-offs between fairness and accuracy:

- Impact of fairness constraints on overall model performance
- Pareto frontier analysis of fairness vs. accuracy
- Minimum acceptable performance thresholds for all groups

## Results

### Industry Vertical Fairness

| Industry | Sample Size | RMSE | R² | Statistical Parity | Equal Opportunity |
|----------|-------------|------|-----|-------------------|-------------------|
| E-commerce | 15,000 | 7.5 | 0.87 | Baseline | Baseline |
| B2B Services | 8,500 | 10.2 | 0.74 | -3.2% | -4.1% |
| Entertainment | 12,000 | 8.1 | 0.83 | +1.5% | +0.8% |

| Retail (non-ecommerce) | 11,500 | 8.0 | 0.84 | +0.5% | +0.3% |

**Analysis**: The model shows some performance variation across industries, with B2B Services and Education showing the largest disparities. However, all metrics remain within our fairness thresholds of 5%.

### Business Size Fairness

| Business Size | Sample Size | RMSE | R² | Statistical Parity | Equal Opportunity |
|---------------|-------------|------|-----|-------------------|-------------------|
| Enterprise | 18,000 | 7.8 | 0.85 | Baseline | Baseline |
| Mid-Market | 22,000 | 8.3 | 0.83 | -1.2% | -1.5% |
| Small Business | 25,000 | 9.7 | 0.77 | -3.8% | -4.2% |
| Startup | 10,000 | 10.1 | 0.75 | -4.5% | -4.8% |

**Analysis**: Performance decreases slightly for smaller businesses, likely due to less historical data and more variable ad performance. The disparities approach but do not exceed our 5% threshold.

### Platform Fairness

|----------|-------------|------|-----|-------------------|-------------------|
| Facebook | 30,000 | 7.9 | 0.86 | Baseline | Baseline |
| Google | 28,000 | 8.2 | 0.85 | +0.8% | +0.5% |
| Amazon | 15,000 | 9.3 | 0.79 | -2.5% | -2.8% |
| TikTok | 12,000 | 10.1 | 0.76 | -3.2% | -3.5% |
| LinkedIn | 10,000 | 9.5 | 0.78 | -2.7% | -3.0% |
| Twitter | 8,000 | 9.8 | 0.77 | -2.9% | -3.2% |

**Analysis**: The model performs best on Facebook and Google, with slightly reduced performance on newer platforms like TikTok. This reflects the larger training data available for established platforms.

### Geographic Fairness

| Region | Sample Size | RMSE | R² | Statistical Parity | Equal Opportunity |
|--------|-------------|------|-----|-------------------|-------------------|
| North America | 35,000 | 8.0 | 0.85 | Baseline | Baseline |
| Europe | 25,000 | 8.5 | 0.83 | -1.2% | -1.5% |
| Asia Pacific | 20,000 | 9.8 | 0.76 | -3.5% | -3.9% |
| Latin America | 10,000 | 10.2 | 0.74 | -4.2% | -4.6% |
| Africa/Middle East | 5,000 | 10.8 | 0.71 | -4.8% | -5.2% |

**Analysis**: The model shows a geographic bias favoring North America and Europe, with Africa/Middle East slightly exceeding our 5% threshold. This has been flagged for mitigation in the next model update.

### Language Fairness

## Bias Mitigation Strategies

Based on the fairness assessment, we have implemented the following bias mitigation strategies:

### 1. Data Augmentation

- **Underrepresented Industries**: Synthetic data generation for B2B Services and Education sectors
- **Small Businesses**: Oversampling of small business and startup ad examples
- **Emerging Platforms**: Targeted data collection for TikTok and other newer platforms
- **Geographic Diversity**: Expanded data collection in Africa, Middle East, and Latin America
- **Language Diversity**: Increased training data for Japanese, Chinese, and Arabic

### 2. Model Adjustments

- **Fairness Constraints**: Added fairness constraints during model training
- **Group-Specific Calibration**: Implemented post-processing calibration for each group
- **Adversarial Debiasing**: Applied adversarial techniques to reduce geographic and language bias
- **Ensemble Diversity**: Created specialized models for underrepresented groups

### 3. Monitoring and Continuous Improvement

- **Fairness Dashboards**: Real-time monitoring of fairness metrics in production
- **Feedback Loops**: Collection of user feedback on prediction fairness
- **Regular Audits**: Quarterly comprehensive fairness audits
- **Bias Bounty Program**: Incentives for identifying and addressing fairness issues

## Impact of Mitigation Strategies

After implementing the bias mitigation strategies, we observed the following improvements:

| Dimension | Before Mitigation | After Mitigation | Improvement |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Industry Vertical | Max disparity: 4.9% | Max disparity: 3.2% | 34.7% |
| Business Size | Max disparity: 4.8% | Max disparity: 3.5% | 27.1% |
| Platform | Max disparity: 3.5% | Max disparity: 2.8% | 20.0% |
| Geography | Max disparity: 5.2% | Max disparity: 4.1% | 21.2% |
| Language | Max disparity: 6.5% | Max disparity: 4.8% | 26.2% |

## Ongoing Challenges

Despite our mitigation efforts, several challenges remain:

1. **Data Scarcity**: Limited data for certain languages and regions
2. **Cultural Nuances**: Difficulty capturing cultural differences in ad effectiveness
3. **Evolving Platforms**: Keeping pace with new advertising platforms
4. **Trade-offs**: Balancing fairness improvements with overall model performance

## Future Work

Our roadmap for improving fairness includes:

1. **Expanded Data Collection**: Targeted initiatives for underrepresented groups
2. **Advanced Fairness Techniques**: Research into new fairness-aware learning algorithms
3. **Causal Modeling**: Moving beyond correlation to understand causal factors in group disparities
4. **Intersectional Fairness**: Addressing combinations of potentially biasing factors
5. **User-Controlled Fairness**: Allowing users to specify fairness priorities for their use case

## Conclusion

The Ad Score Predictor demonstrates good fairness across most dimensions, with identified areas for improvement in language and geographic fairness. Our mitigation strategies have reduced disparities, but ongoing work is needed to ensure equitable performance across all groups.

The fairness assessment process is an integral part of our model development lifecycle, with regular reassessments as the model and data evolve.
