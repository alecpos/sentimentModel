## ML Architecture

![ML Architecture Overview](../images/ml_architecture.png)

The WITHIN ML system is built on a modular architecture with these key components:

1. **Data Processing Layer**: Handles data ingestion, cleaning, and transformation
2. **Feature Engineering Layer**: Creates features from raw data
3. **Model Layer**: Implements prediction models
4. **Evaluation Layer**: Assesses model performance
5. **Deployment Layer**: Serves models in production

## Feature Categories

### Ad Content Features

Features derived from ad content:

- **Text Features**: Derived from ad copy using NLP techniques
- **Visual Features**: Extracted from ad images and videos
- **Structural Features**: Based on ad format and structure
- **Call-to-Action Features**: Specific to CTA elements

### Historical Performance Features

Features based on historical performance:

- **Engagement Metrics**: CTR, view rate, engagement rate
- **Conversion Metrics**: Conversion rate, CPA, ROAS
- **Temporal Patterns**: Time-based performance patterns
- **Audience Response**: How different audiences responded

### Contextual Features

Features related to context:

- **Platform-Specific**: Features relevant to specific ad platforms
- **Industry Vertical**: Industry-specific indicators
- **Competitive Landscape**: Competitive performance metrics
- **Seasonality**: Seasonal factors affecting performance

## Model Training Infrastructure

The system uses a robust ML training infrastructure:

- **Model Registry**: Centralized repository for model versioning
- **Feature Store**: Consistent feature management
- **Experiment Tracking**: Track model experiments and results
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Automated tuning of model parameters
- **Distributed Training**: Scale training across multiple machines

## Evaluation Framework

Models are evaluated using a comprehensive framework:

- **Performance Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, RÂ², correlation with actual performance
- **Fairness Metrics**: Equal opportunity, demographic parity
- **Robustness Testing**: Performance under various conditions
- **A/B Testing**: Comparison with previous model versions

## Model Deployment

Models are deployed using:

- **Model Serving API**: Fast, scalable prediction API
- **Batch Prediction**: Efficient batch processing
- **Model Monitoring**: Tracking of performance and drift
- **Shadow Deployment**: Risk-free testing in production

## ML Implementation Principles

The ML implementation follows these core principles:

1. **Explainability**: All predictions include feature importance and explanations
2. **Fairness**: Models are evaluated and optimized for fairness across segments
3. **Reproducibility**: Training is reproducible with fixed random seeds
4. **Modularity**: Components can be improved independently
5. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging
6. **Efficiency**: Models optimize for performance vs. resource usage

## ML Development Lifecycle

![ML Development Lifecycle](../images/ml_lifecycle.png)

1. **Problem Definition**: Define the prediction task and success metrics
2. **Data Collection**: Gather and prepare training data
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create features from raw data
4. **Model Development**: Develop and train candidate models
5. **Model Evaluation**: Compare models against baselines
6. **Model Deployment**: Deploy selected model to production
7. **Monitoring & Maintenance**: Monitor performance and retrain as needed

## Implementation Examples

### Ad Score Prediction Example

```python
from within.models import AdScorePredictor

# Initialize predictor
predictor = AdScorePredictor()

# Prepare ad data
ad_data = {
    "headline": "Limited Time Offer: 20% Off All Products",
    "description": "Shop our entire collection and save with this exclusive discount.",
    "cta": "Shop Now",
    "platform": "facebook",
    "industry": "retail"
}

# Generate prediction
prediction = predictor.predict(ad_data)

# Access results
score = prediction["score"]
confidence = prediction["confidence"]
explanations = prediction["explanations"]
```

### Account Health Assessment Example

```python
from within.models import AccountHealthPredictor

# Initialize predictor
predictor = AccountHealthPredictor()

# Prepare account data
account_data = {
    "account_id": "123456789",
    "platform": "google",
    "time_range": "last_30_days"
}

# Generate prediction
health_assessment = predictor.assess(account_data)

# Access results
health_score = health_assessment["score"]
risk_factors = health_assessment["risk_factors"]
recommendations = health_assessment["recommendations"]
```
