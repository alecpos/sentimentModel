# ML Model Card: Ad Sentiment Analyzer

**IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED**


## Model Overview
- **Model Name:** Ad Sentiment Analyzer
- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Type:** Sentiment Classification (NLP)
- **Purpose:** Analyze the sentiment of advertising copy to predict effectiveness and user reception
- **Created Date:** 2023-03-01
- **Last Updated:** 2023-03-10

## Intended Use
- **Primary Use Cases:** 
  - Analyze ad copy sentiment to predict performance
  - Filter potentially negative or off-brand messaging
  - Compare sentiment across multiple ad variations
  - Provide input features for ad performance prediction models

- **Out-of-Scope Uses:**
  - General text sentiment analysis outside of advertising context
  - Emotional analysis beyond positive/neutral/negative classification
  - Real-time user feedback analysis
  - Language detection or translation

- **Target Users:**
  - Digital marketers optimizing ad copy
  - Campaign managers evaluating ad performance
  - Content creators seeking copy improvement guidance
  - Ad effectiveness prediction systems

## Training Data
- **Dataset Sources:**
  - WITHIN Ad Performance Database (10,000+ ad copies with performance metrics)
  - Public advertising corpus (2,000+ examples from competitor ads)
  - Manually annotated sentiment dataset (500 samples with balanced distribution)

- **Dataset Size:** 12,500 examples

- **Feature Distribution:**
  - Sentiment classes: 42% positive, 35% neutral, 23% negative
  - Ad categories: retail (30%), finance (15%), technology (20%), lifestyle (25%), other (10%)
  - Ad length: short (<50 words, 40%), medium (50-100 words, 45%), long (>100 words, 15%)

- **Data Preparation:**
  - Cleaning: lowercasing, punctuation normalization, special character handling
  - Tokenization: advertising-specific tokenization preserving brand names and product terms
  - Preprocessing: domain-specific stopword removal, lemmatization

## Model Architecture
- **Algorithm Type:** Fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- **Architecture Details:**
  - Base model: bert-base-uncased (110M parameters)
  - Custom classification head: 3-class softmax output (positive, neutral, negative)
  - Sequence length: 512 tokens maximum
  - Domain adaptation: Additional pre-training on advertising corpus

- **Feature Inputs:**
  - Preprocessed ad text (tokenized, normalized)
  - Optional context features (ad platform, ad format, target audience)

- **Output Format:**
  - Primary sentiment label (positive, neutral, negative)
  - Confidence score (0-1) for predicted sentiment
  - Individual class probabilities for all sentiment classes

## Performance Metrics
| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Precision | 0.87 | Average across all classes |
| Recall | 0.84 | Average across all classes |
| F1 Score | 0.855 | Balanced metric |
| Accuracy | 0.89 | Overall classification accuracy |
| Processing Speed | 75ms | Average per ad on CPU inference |

## Limitations and Biases
- **Known Limitations:**
  - English language focus (limited effectiveness for non-English text)
  - Reduced accuracy for very short ad copy (<10 words)
  - Challenge with heavily sarcastic or ironic content
  - Limited understanding of emoji-only or emoji-heavy content

- **Potential Biases:**
  - Performance varies across industry categories (higher accuracy in retail, lower in finance)
  - May interpret aggressive sales language as negative even when effective
  - Cultural idioms and expressions may be misclassified

- **Evaluation Results by Segment:**
  | Segment | Accuracy | F1 Score | Notes |
  |---------|----------|----------|-------|
  | Retail | 0.92 | 0.89 | Strongest performance |
  | Finance | 0.83 | 0.79 | More challenging terminology |
  | Technology | 0.87 | 0.85 | Good with technical terms |
  | Short Ads | 0.84 | 0.81 | Less context available |
  | Long Ads | 0.91 | 0.88 | More context improves accuracy |

## Ethical Considerations
- **Data Privacy:**
  - No personally identifiable information used in training
  - Ad content anonymized by removing specific brand names
  - Training data usage complies with data retention policies

- **Fairness Assessment:**
  - Model tested across different demographic targeting
  - No significant performance disparity across target demographics
  - Regular bias audits scheduled quarterly

- **Potential Risks:**
  - May influence ad creation toward homogenized sentiment
  - Could create feedback loops by prioritizing certain sentiment patterns
  - Might oversimplify the relationship between sentiment and actual ad effectiveness

## Usage Instructions
- **Required Environment:**
  - Python 3.9+
  - PyTorch 1.10+
  - Transformers 4.15+
  - 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
  - GPU optional but recommended for batch processing

- **Setup Steps:**
  ```python
  from app.models.ml.nlp import SentimentAnalyzer
  
  # Initialize with default model
  sentiment_analyzer = SentimentAnalyzer()
  
  # Or specify custom model path
  sentiment_analyzer = SentimentAnalyzer(model_path="models/custom_sentiment_model")
  ```

- **Inference Examples:**
  ```python
  # Single text analysis
  result = await sentiment_analyzer.analyze("Get our amazing new product today and save 20%!")
  print(f"Sentiment: {result['sentiment']}, Confidence: {result['confidence']}")
  
  # Batch processing
  texts = ["Limited time offer!", "Product unavailable in your region", "Best deal of the year!"]
  results = await sentiment_analyzer.analyze_batch(texts)
  ```

- **API Reference:** See `app/api/v1/endpoints/ad_content_endpoints.py` for API integration details

## Maintenance
- **Owner:** ML Engineering Team
- **Update Frequency:** Quarterly retraining with new data
- **Monitoring Plan:**
