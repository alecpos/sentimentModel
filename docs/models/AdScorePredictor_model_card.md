# Model Card: AdScorePredictor

## Model Overview

- **Model Name**: AdScorePredictor
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Type**: Hybrid ML model for ad score prediction
- **Created**: 2025-03-12 11:57:15
- **Last Updated**: 2025-03-12 11:57:15

## Description

Class representing a predictor for ad performance scores using a hybrid machine learning approach.

The AdScorePredictor combines tree-based and neural network models to generate accurate
predictions of advertisement performance. It uses a multi-modal approach that can incorporate
textual, numerical, and categorical features, with specialized attention mechanisms to capture
cross-modal interactions between different feature types.

This predictor implements a comprehensive ad scoring system that provides both point estimates
and uncertainty quantification, enabling more informed decision making in advertising campaigns.
The model supports both batch and single-item prediction modes, with configurable preprocessing
pipelines for different feature modalities.

## Intended Use

This model is designed for predicting advertisement performance scores to help optimize ad campaigns
and improve targeting efficiency.

## Model Architecture

The AdScorePredictor implements a hybrid machine learning approach, combining:

- Tree-based models for handling categorical features and capturing non-linear relationships
- Neural network components for complex feature interactions and representation learning

## Model Parameters

### Initialization Parameters

- **input_dim** (int, optional): Dimensionality of the input feature space. If None,
- **tree_model** (object, optional): Pre-trained tree-based model (XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.).
- **nn_model** (torch.nn.Module, optional): Pre-trained neural network model.
- **encoder** (object, optional): Feature encoder for transforming raw input data.
- **scaler** (sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler, optional): Scaler for normalizing
- **preprocessor** (sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline, optional): Pipeline for data preprocessing.
- **use_gpu** (bool, optional): Whether to use GPU acceleration for neural network
- **model_config** (dict, optional): Configuration parameters for model architecture

## Prediction Interface

Make predictions using both tree and neural network models.

### Input Parameters

- **X** (None): Input features (DataFrame, numpy array, or dictionary)

### Output

Dictionary with prediction results including 'score' and 'confidence'

## Training Interface

Fit both tree and neural network models.

### Training Parameters

- **X** (None): Input features
- **y** (None): Target values

## Usage Examples

```python
>>> from app.models.ml.prediction import AdScorePredictor
>>> predictor = AdScorePredictor(input_dim=128, use_gpu=True, model_config={'layers': [256, 128]})
>>> predictor.fit(train_data, train_labels)
>>> scores = predictor.predict(test_data)
>>> print(f"Predicted ad score: {scores[0]:.2f}")
Predicted ad score: 0.87
```

## Limitations and Ethical Considerations

### Limitations
- The model assumes input data follows the same distribution as the training data
- Performance may degrade with significant data drift
- Not designed to handle real-time streaming data without proper optimization

### Ethical Considerations
- The model should be regularly monitored for bias in predictions
- Does not collect or store personally identifiable information
- Intended for business metrics optimization, not for decisions about individuals

## Maintenance and Governance

- **Owner**: ML Team
- **Review Schedule**: Quarterly
- **Retraining Schedule**: Monthly or upon significant data drift detection
- **Feedback Mechanism**: File issues in the project repository or contact ml-team@example.com
