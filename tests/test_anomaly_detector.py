"""Unit tests for the Anomaly Detection System.

This module contains comprehensive test cases for the Enhanced Anomaly Detector,
covering model initialization, training, detection capabilities, and edge cases.
The test suite follows pytest best practices and ensures reproducible results
through proper seed management.

Key areas tested:
    - Model initialization and configuration
    - Training process and reproducibility
    - Anomaly detection on normal and anomalous data
    - Input validation and error handling
    - Batch processing capabilities
    - Device compatibility (CPU/GPU)
    - Concept drift monitoring (NEW)
    - Adversarial robustness (NEW)

Example:
    Run these tests using pytest:
        $ pytest tests/test_anomaly_detector.py -v
