## Detailed Results

### Target Gender

#### Demographic Parity

Demographic parity measures whether the model predicts positive outcomes at the same rate across different demographic groups.

- Overall positive prediction rate: 0.4444
- Group positive prediction rates:
  - female: 0.3750
  - male: 1.0000
- Disparity ratio: 0.3750
- Maximum disparity: 0.6250

#### Equal Opportunity

Equal opportunity measures whether the model has the same true positive rate (recall) across different demographic groups.

- Average true positive rate: 0.8750
- Group true positive rates:
  - female: 0.7500
  - male: 1.0000
- TPR disparity ratio: 0.7500
- Maximum TPR disparity: 0.2500

## Model Performance

- Accuracy: 0.8889
- Precision: 1.0000
- Recall: 0.8000
- F1 Score: 0.8889

## Recommendations

The model does not meet the minimum fairness criteria for all protected attributes. Consider the following recommendations to address fairness issues:

1. **Bias Mitigation Techniques**: Consider implementing pre-processing, in-processing, or post-processing bias mitigation techniques.
2. **Data Collection**: Review data collection procedures to ensure representative sampling across all demographic groups.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Review features that may introduce or amplify biases in the model.
4. **Model Selection**: Consider using different model architectures that may be less prone to learning biased patterns.
5. **Threshold Adjustment**: Consider group-specific thresholds to balance error rates across groups.
