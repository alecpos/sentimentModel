# Enhanced Sentiment Analysis Results Summary

## Model Performance

We successfully trained enhanced sentiment analysis models using different dataset sizes:

| Dataset Size | Model Type | Accuracy | F1 Score | Training Time |
|--------------|------------|----------|----------|---------------|
| 50,000 | Logistic Regression | 78.34% | - | - |
| 80,000 | Logistic Regression | 78.89% | 78.89% | 106.25 seconds |
| 100,000 | Logistic Regression | 78.99% | 78.98% | 120.03 seconds |

## Key Enhancements Implemented

1. **Bias Mitigation Techniques**
   - Gender-neutral text preprocessing
   - Data reweighting to balance outcomes across demographic groups
   - Adversarial training weights (range: 0.99-1.02)

2. **Fairness Evaluation**
   - Intersectional analysis across gender, age groups, and location
   - Fairness metrics calculation including disparate impact and equalized odds
   - Visualization through demographic intersection heatmaps

3. **Text Processing Improvements**
   - Advanced feature extraction beyond TF-IDF
   - Custom features for sentiment-related word counts
   - Special pattern detection (hashtags, mentions, etc.)

## Fairness Analysis Results

- **Fairness Concern Level**: Low
- **Maximum Accuracy Disparity**: ~0.03 (considered Low)
- **Disparate Impact**: Minor variations observed (0.93-1.06), within acceptable range

The intersectional analysis showed that different demographic groups receive relatively balanced prediction outcomes, with disparate impact ratios ranging from 0.93 to 1.06, indicating minimal bias in the model's predictions.

## Impact of Dataset Size

Increasing the dataset size from 80,000 to 100,000 samples resulted in:
- Slight improvement in accuracy (78.89% → 78.99%)
- Slight improvement in F1 score (78.89% → 78.98%)
- Increased training time (106.25s → 120.03s)

This suggests that:
1. The model is beginning to reach a plateau in performance with this architecture
2. For significant improvements, more sophisticated models (transformers) or feature engineering would be needed
3. The trade-off between increased dataset size and performance gain becomes less favorable as we add more data

## Next Steps

1. **Advanced Models**: Implementing transformer-based models (requires resolving TensorFlow/Metal dependencies)
2. **Feature Engineering**: Developing more domain-specific features for Twitter sentiment analysis
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters for better performance
4. **Production Deployment**: Creating a robust API and monitoring system for the model

The current model achieves a good balance between performance and fairness, with no significant bias detected across demographic intersections.
