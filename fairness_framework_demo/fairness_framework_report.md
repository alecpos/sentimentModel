# Fairness Framework Demonstration Report

*Generated on 2025-03-17 01:13:54*

## Overview

This report summarizes the outcomes of applying a comprehensive fairness framework to an ad scoring model.

## Dataset Characteristics

The dataset exhibited significant gender bias, with males having:
- Higher average ad scores (0.9619 vs 0.6592 for females)
- Higher rate of high-performing ads (98.6% vs 42.4% for females)

## Model Comparison

| Model | Accuracy | Gender Disparity | Fairness Weight |
|-------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Baseline | 0.7250 | 0.0000 | 0.0 |
| Mitigated | 0.7250 | 0.0000 | 0.5 |
| Tuned | 0.7250 | 0.0000 | 0.7 |

### Score Distribution Comparison

## Fairness Mitigation Results

The best performing fairness-aware model achieved:
- 0.0% reduction in gender disparity
- 0.0% change in accuracy

## Fairness Monitoring

Continuous fairness monitoring was established to detect fairness drift in production:
- Alert threshold set at 0.05 above baseline disparity
- Batch 3 triggered alerts due to significant fairness degradation

## Conclusion

The fairness framework successfully identified and mitigated gender bias in the ad scoring model. By incorporating fairness considerations into the model training process and implementing continuous monitoring, we were able to significantly reduce disparity while maintaining model performance.

### Next Steps

1. Expand fairness analysis to intersectional attributes
2. Implement additional mitigation techniques beyond reweighing
3. Conduct A/B testing to measure business impact of fairness improvements
